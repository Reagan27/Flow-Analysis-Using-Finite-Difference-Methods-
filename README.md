## Finite Difference Method for Flow Analysis

### Introduction:
This Python script implements the spatial finite difference method to analyze two-dimensional flow over a rectangular beam placed in a flow coming parallel to the front at a constant velocity U. It iteratively updates and solves the motion equations for the stream function and vorticity, visualizing the results through contour plots.

### Key Features:
- Solves the motion equations for steady flow using the finite difference method.
- Visualizes the stream function and vorticity using contour plots.
- Allows exploration of flow patterns by adjusting parameters.

### Usage:
Ensure you have NumPy and Matplotlib installed. Simply run the script, and it will generate contour plots showing the stream function and flow vorticity.

### Results:
The script generates contour plots of the stream function and vorticity, providing insights into the flow behavior around the rectangular beam.

### Conclusion:
By leveraging the finite difference method, this script offers a computational approach to analyzing fluid flow phenomena, which is valuable for understanding and predicting flow patterns in various engineering applications.
